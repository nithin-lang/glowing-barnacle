## Rust Programming Tutorial

Welcome to the Rust Programming Tutorial! ðŸš€  
This repository contains examples and notes organized by chapters to help you learn Rust step-by-step, starting from primitive data types to complex collections and error handling.

---

## ðŸ“š Chapters Overview

### Chapter 1: Primitive Data Types
Understand the basic data types that Rust uses to handle:
- Numbers (integers, floating-points)
- Booleans
- Characters

### Chapter 2: Compound Data Types
Explore complex data structures:
- **Tuples** â€” group multiple values of different types.
- **Arrays** â€” fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.

### Chapter 3: Functions
Learn how to define and use functions, and understand Rust's approach to:
- Code organization
- Code reuse

### Chapter 4: Ownership
Dive into Rust's unique memory management system:
- Manage resources safely without a garbage collector.
- Understand how ownership works.

### Chapter 5: Borrowing and References
Expand on memory safety:
- Create references to variables without taking ownership.
- Understand mutable and immutable borrowing.

### Chapter 6: Variables and Mutability
Discover how Rust handles:
- Immutable variables (by default)
- Mutability when needed

### Chapter 7: Constants
Work with constants:
- Immutable by default
- Never mutable after being set
- Used for safe, fixed values

### Chapter 8: Shadowing
Enhance flexibility in variable handling:
- Redefine a variable with the same name.
- Understand how shadowing differs from mutability.

### Chapter 9: Comments
Master the art of documentation:
- Write clear and useful comments.
- Help future readers (and yourself) understand the code better.

### Chapter 10: Introduction to Control Flow
Learn decision-making in Rust using:
- `if`
- `else if`
- `else` statements

### Chapter 11: Looping Mechanisms
Explore the three looping constructs:
- `loop` â€” runs indefinitely until stopped.
- `while` â€” runs while a condition holds true.
- `for` â€” iterates over ranges, arrays, and collections efficiently.

### Chapter 12: Defining Structs
Create your own complex types:
- Bundle related data into **structs**.
- Learn about immutability in structured data.

### Chapter 13: Introduction to Enums
Work with **enums**:
- Define a type by enumerating its possible values (variants).
- Handle related types safely and cleanly.

### Chapter 14: Error Handling Techniques
Understand Rustâ€™s safe error-handling philosophy:
- Use `Result` and `Option` types to manage errors and absence of values predictably.

### Chapter 15: Collection Types
Manage groups of data efficiently using:
- **Vectors** â€” dynamic arrays.
- **Strings** â€” flexible, UTF-8 encoded text storage.
- **HashMaps** â€” key-value pair storage for fast lookup.
